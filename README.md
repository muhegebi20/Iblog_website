Hello folks. on this website most of the frontend code doesn't blong to me. I just downloaded it. Thanks to Arin Yazilim.
but all the javascript code running on the backend are mine. and of course I have added some different pages to the original template I downloaded. 
I will continue to develop this website to the end adding all the necessary functionalities like authentication, authorization, sanitizing data and some security issues.
i you want to pull and check on your machine, be sure to have nodejs and all the dependecies installed on your computer.
don't forget to follow my github.
thanks ✌️✌️✌️
